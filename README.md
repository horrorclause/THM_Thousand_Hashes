# THM_Thousand_Hashes
This is a **python 3** script for solving task #10 of WithYouWithMe's brickathon (https://tryhackme.com/room/thebrickathonpreseasonvi) 

Enter string that needs to be hashed. It will be hashed through five algorithms (in this order SHA512 -> MD5 -> SHA256 -> SHA1 -> SHA224) "n" iterations set by you.

The string you input, number of cycles, and final hash (SHA224) is displayed:
